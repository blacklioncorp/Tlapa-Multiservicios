## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Olive green (#5D8A27), drawing from the green in the Tlapa logo for a natural and municipal feel.
- Background color: Light green (#E4EFE1), a lighter tint of the olive to provide contrast.
- Accent color: Gold (#D4A743) echoing the yellow/gold from the Tlapa logo, will be used for highlighting key actions.
- Font Pairing: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headings, 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text.
- Use map-based icons related to services such as water drop, building, and document, based on Google Maps icons.
- Mobile-first design with a clear hierarchy; the mobile app features a prominent map for technicians.
- Subtle transitions for map marker updates and payment status changes for clarity and feedback.
